🎧 DJ Electrohead — App Description
DJ Electrohead is a browser-based interactive DJ simulator with two distinct game modes, where users perform for an AI-judged virtual crowd. Players aim to keep the vibe meter high, using music to engage and entertain.

🎮 Game Modes:
Crowdplay Mode
Users play songs using the Spotify Web API. The AI crowd, powered by Nebius AI Studio, rates your vibe based on how well each track maintains energy and flow. Higher vibe levels unlock more animated reactions from the DJ and crowd.

Strudel Mode
Users drag and drop pre-made musical loops (powered by Strudel) to build a mix live. Each combination is scored by the AI for creativity and rhythm. The DJ and vibe meter respond accordingly.
